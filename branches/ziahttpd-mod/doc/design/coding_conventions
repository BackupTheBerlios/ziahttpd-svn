[*] Header files protection
Header files must be protected with a macro following this syntax $(NAMESPACE)_$(FILE)_HH
If the file is the root one defining a new namespace, don't put an underscore in front of the macro.

[*] Class attributes
Class attributes must be suffixed by underscore ('_')


[*] Return values
In order to simplify usage of your apis, all public functions should return a bool value, set
to false to indicate that an error occured during the function processing.
In addition, the user should be able to pass a pointer to a value result for the error code
to be retrieved; This pointer should have a default value of NULL, so that the uninterested user
has not to keep the error code.
For instance:
bool open(const char* filename, int* err = 0);
