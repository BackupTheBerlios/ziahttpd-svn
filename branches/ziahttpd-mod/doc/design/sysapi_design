[*] Note on the sysapi design


[*] Goals
sysapi is a generic way to interact with system specific apis to handle
common concepts, such as file handling, error report, thread and process creations,
memory management...


[*] Notes for zia developpers
Always use sysapi facility to develop system specific functions


[*] Using the sysapi namespace
sysapi::{file, process, thread, error} are the namespaces planned to be implemented.
@see include/sysapi.hh, include/{win32, posix}.hh for interfaces
@see sysapi/{win32, posix}/{file, process, thread, error}.cc for implementations


[*] Work in progress
posix implementation
implementation of the mutex objects(do it in a class?)
implementation of a class for the mmap interface(both on win32 and posix operating systems)
